### I've never used github / How do I install it?
To install this application you need to give your phone permissions to install apps from outside the Play Store, you can do so in the settings or just wait for your phone to prompt you to give permissions when you actually install the app:
- Download the `.apk` file of the latest version from https://github.com/BarcodeStock/releases
- Once downloaded open it from you phone Downloads
- Give your phone permissions to install non play store apps
- Touch Install and wait for your phone to install the app
- Open and use the app

### Why isn't this app on the Play Store?
It started as personal app I made for a fellow friend who needed something like this to store products barcodes and metadata while only using a single app; So I'm not expecting it to become a popular app or project, although if more users become interested in this I may release it on the Play Store in the future
